This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  The code attempts to create two mutable references (`y` and `z`) to the same variable (`x`), which is forbidden by Rust's borrow checker to prevent data races. The solution shows how to refactor the code to avoid this error, either by using only one mutable borrow or cloning the value.
